# üîó The Post-Skype World: Secure & Open Communication Tools for Windows & Linux

As Microsoft quietly sunsets Skype, it's time to re-evaluate our tools for digital communication. For users of **[CTP-EOS Linux](https://ctp-eos.org)** *(Note: we are still early stage/early inception/inception stages with CTP-EOS)* and those who value privacy, transparency, and control, this is an opportunity‚Äînot a loss.

Below, we showcase powerful **Skype alternatives** that respect your sovereignty, support Linux/Windows, and align with the CTP-EOS vision of decentralization and security.

## üõ°Ô∏è Digital Sovereignty Through Communication

With the fall of Skype, users are unshackled from proprietary surveillance systems. The rise of open alternatives empowers individuals and teams to build communications grounded in freedom, not profit.

If you're working on CTP Energy research, coordinating citizen science, or broadcasting to the fringe, these tools let you stay secure, private, and sovereign.

üì° **Empower your voice. Choose open networks. Choose CTP-EOS. Choose Digital Freedom**
```
